# evm-to-eutxo-translator
An open source developer toolkit that helps translate Solidity smart contract patterns into eUTXO-compatible templates for Cardano using Aiken and Plutus.

# EVM-to-eUTXO Contract Translator Toolkit

A developer-friendly toolkit for translating Ethereum Solidity contract patterns (like ERC-20, Ownable, AccessControl) into eUTXO-compatible templates using Cardano's Aiken and Plutus languages.

## 🚀 Overview

This project bridges the gap between Ethereum's account-based model and Cardano's extended UTXO model by offering:

- 🧱 A library of 10+ common Solidity smart contract patterns rewritten in Aiken/Plutus
- 🛠️ A translation engine that maps Solidity logic to Cardano-native equivalents
- 🌐 A clean, open-source web UI to explore and access contract templates
- 📚 Documentation, code comments, and usage tutorials for each translated pattern

## 🎯 Goal

Lower the learning curve for Ethereum developers and accelerate Cardano adoption by simplifying the migration of existing smart contract logic into the eUTXO model.

## 🔍 Features

- Solidity → Aiken/Plutus translation templates
- Open source from day one (MIT License)
- Built-in testnet examples and integration with Cardano dev tools like Lucid
- Web-based interface for quick access and educational exploration
